    "Decision tree is a type of **supervised learning** algorithm that works both for **regression** and **classification** problems.

In this technique, we **split** the population or sample **into two or more homogeneous sets** (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables. Decision Tree's are really popular because they are very easy to **interpret** and forms the basis for more complex bagging techniques such as **Random Forest**. "

Decision tree splits the nodes on **all available variables** and then selects the split which results in **most homogeneous sub-nodes**.
